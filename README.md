# Hello, I'm Eleanor
I like to build and write stories from data. My favorite projects are those that have a meaningful impact- whether that's on lives or organizations.

I'm a **communication graduate who learned how to code**. That means my work is driven by the audience and user in mind upfront. I've gained competencies by self-learning, learning alongside amazing colleagues, and joining boot camps.

Recently, I've started teaching as a way to not only grow more confident in my work but also to meaningfully be a part of the Philippine data science and analytics industry. 

I heard we could create online portfolios on GitHub - so please consider this site a work in progress. I look forward to learning how to visualize on this platform.
